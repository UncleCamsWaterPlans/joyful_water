Please consider my submission for the 2024 Plotnine competition. I adapted this from previously successful R code (GGplot2). While I initially intended to use a ridgeline plot for clearer data concentration visualization, I found that the heatmap, which I had previously abandoned, worked surprisingly well in plotnine.

I hope you find it compelling!


## Data Import and Preparation

Data has been extracted from the Queensland Government Department of Environment, Science and Innovation. Site-specific metadata provides context for the site locations.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
from plotnine import *

#import concentration data
df = pd.read_csv('data/catchment_NNO3_all.csv')
print(df.head())
#import site information
sitelist = pd.read_csv('data/sitelist.csv')
print(sitelist.head())
```

## Data joining and preprocessing
```{python}
# Subset to include only 'GSnum' and 'Value' columns
subset_df = df[['GSnum', 'Value']]

# Group by 'GSnum' and calculate the median for the 'Value' and 'Quality' columns
median_summary = subset_df.groupby('GSnum').median().reset_index()

# Rename the 'Value' column to 'median'
median_summary.rename(columns={'Value': 'median'}, inplace=True)

# Perform a left join of the original DataFrame with the median summary DataFrame
merged_df = pd.merge(df, median_summary, on='GSnum', how='left')
merged_df = pd.merge(merged_df, sitelist[['GSnum', 'Site type', 'Site code']], on='GSnum', how='left')

# Concatenate columns with separator
merged_df['combined_col'] = merged_df['Site type'] + ' // ' + merged_df['Site code']
```


## Date parsing and monthly aggregation
```{python}
# Parse the 'Date' column from the timestamp
merged_df['ts'] = pd.to_datetime(merged_df['ts'])

# Group by month and calculate median of 'Value' column
monthly_median = merged_df.groupby([merged_df['ts'].dt.month, 'name', 'combined_col'])['Value'].max()

# Convert the Series to a DataFrame
df = monthly_median.reset_index(name='value')

# Create a list of month names
month_names = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sept', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec']

# Map the month numbers to month names
df['month_name'] = df['ts'].apply(lambda x: month_names[x-1])
df
```

# Visualization
```{python}
(
    ggplot(df, aes(x='ts', y='combined_col', fill='value')) +
    geom_tile(aes(width=0.95, height=0.95)) +
    theme_dark(base_size=11, base_family=None) +
    geom_text(aes(label="value.round(2).astype(str)"), size=6, color='#DDDEDF', show_legend=False) +
    scale_fill_cmap(cmap_name="inferno", name="Max Monthly Nitrate-N Concentration (mg/L)") +
    #scale_fill_gradient(cmap_name="viridis", low="#3BC4A4", high="#CC334E") +  # Adjust low and high colors as needed
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=range(1, 13), labels=month_names, name="") +
    scale_y_discrete(name="Site type and ID") +  # Change y-axis label
    theme(axis_text_x=element_text(angle=30, hjust=1.5),
          legend_position='top',  # Move legend to the top
          legend_direction='horizontal')  # Horizontal orientation of legend
)
```

This graph displays the maximum monthly Nitrate-N concentration (measured in mg/L) for various sites over 4 years of monitoring (2020 - 2024). Here are some key observations:

- Site types are categorized as:
    - Reference
    - Impact
    - End of System
- The concentration values are represented by both numbers and a color scale, with darker colors indicating lower concentrations and brighter colors (yellow) indicating higher concentrations.
- Generally, the **Impact** and **End of System** sites show *higher* nitrate concentrations compared to **Reference** sites.
- Some sites, particularly Impact sites like **TBH**, **FCW**, and **LCL**, show *very* high concentrations (above 4 mg/L) in certain months.
- There's considerable variation both across sites and across months for individual sites.
- The highest recorded concentration appears to be **6.96 mg/L at the End of System // CCC site in December**.
- Reference sites generally maintain **lower** concentrations throughout the year.
- Some sites show clear seasonal patterns, while others have more sporadic high concentration months.

This graph allows for comparison of nitrate levels across different types of sites and seasons, which could be useful for environmental monitoring or water quality assessment.
